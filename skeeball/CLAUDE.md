A realistic arcade skeeball alley, rebuilt **from scratch on 2026-08-13** (nothing of the
previous build — layout, art, physics, structure — was carried over or consulted). The previous
build was then kept in the hub as **Skeeball_old** (`skeeball_old/`, hub id `skeeball-old`;
Matt's ask, same day) for side-by-side comparison while this machine is tuned — see that
folder's CLAUDE.md for exactly what its rename changed. Both builds record into the SHARED
`skeeball` stats id, and both use the board id `classic`, so that machine's records (bests, the
daily map, the top-score panel) are one continuous bucket across the two builds — deliberate,
so no play is ever orphaned. One machine exists so far, **THE CLASSIC**: a boardwalk cabinet with a varnished oak
lane, the burnt-orange board with the white cup ladder, twin corner 100 cups, and a marquee. The
player swipes up the lane; the swipe's speed is the roll's power and its angle is the aim. Nine
balls to a rack.

**The board was rebuilt to the REAL classic layout on 2026-08-13** against reference photos Matt
provided, after the first version shipped a wrong "bullseye" board invented from memory — the
exact failure `VISUAL-PROCESS.md` exists to prevent (look at the picture before you write code;
if there is no picture, ask for one). That rule was read and skipped anyway; do not repeat this.
The photos and researched behavior now live in this file and in `boards.js`'s `scoring` comment.

**Admin only for now**, exactly like Pinball: the hub entry carries `devOnly: true`. Unlike
Pinball, the stats id already has REAL family history (the game was live for a couple of hours
on 2026-08-11 under the previous build), which drives every storage decision below.

## Hub integration

| Thing | Value |
|---|---|
| Registry | `module: '../skeeball/js/ui.js'`, `immersive: true`, `devOnly: true`, hub id `skeeball` |
| Stats id | `skeeball` (recorder `recordSkeeball`, sub-counter `sk`) — **pre-existing, frozen** |
| CSS root / prefix | `.sk-root` / `.sk-` |
| Settings key | `gamehub.skeeball.v1` (one preference: the selected machine) |
| Save key | `gamehub.skeeball.save.v1` (the mid-rack snapshot) |
| Difficulty axis | none — `byDiff` is keyed by BOARD ID (Hill Climb's stages-as-the-axis precedent) |
| `isInProgress()` | the **autosave/resume** meaning: always `false`; see below |

`isInProgress()` returns `false` even mid-rack (Escoba's class of the contract, not Ball Run's):
the between-throws state is the stable state of skeeball, `ui.js` snapshots it to
`gamehub.skeeball.save.v1` after **every settled ball**. While a snapshot is banked the setup
screen offers BOTH actions: "Resume rack · N/9" (primary) AND "New game" (ghost) — never only
one. New game discards the snapshot (`clearSave()` before `_startGame(null)`): the snapshot is a
resume convenience, not earned history, and the player pressed the button that says so with
Resume sitting directly above it (Matt, 2026-08-13: a save must never trap the player into
resuming). A ball actually in flight resolves in under two seconds and is deliberately not part
of the saved state — the throw a player abandons mid-air was theirs to abandon, and the ball is
only spent when it settles, so resuming re-serves it.

`immersive: true`: `.sk-root` is `position: fixed; inset: 0` at `z-index: 1` (Pinball's shape),
so the hub's floating back button rides on top; `.sk-hud` carries `padding-left: 76px` and the
gallery `padding-top: 84px` to clear it.

## Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `js/vendor/` | **vendored battle-tested libraries** (2026-08-13, Matt's explicit instruction - see below): `cannon-es.js` (rigid-body physics, ESM), `three.module.min.js` + `three.core.min.js` (renderer). Committed files, no build step, no network fetch. Never hand-edit them |
| `js/machine.js` | the machine's GEOMETRY, once, in metres: every floor, wall, band segment and collar as data. physics.js builds cannon bodies from it and render.js builds three meshes from it, so the wall you see IS the wall the ball hits |
| `js/boards.js` | the machine registry: identity, look tokens, the `geom` block (sizes, angles, launch speeds, hole layout), unlock chain. Pure |
| `js/physics.js` | the ball, simulated by cannon-es: materials/contact tuning, hole capture, trough scoring, the dish, the watchdog. Deterministic, no rng |
| `js/game.js` | the rules of a rack: nine balls, scoring, the event stream, snapshot/restore, the recorder payload. Pure |
| `js/render.js` | the machine on screen, drawn by three.js: scene from machine.js + cosmetic dressing, lights/shadows, painted textures, ball mesh synced from the physics body |
| `js/howto.js` | the How To Play sheet content (repo pattern, `tic-tac-toe/CLAUDE.md`) |
| `js/strings.js` | the EN/ES dictionary |
| `js/ui.js` | DOM shell, the swipe, storage, records panel, the hub module contract |
| `js/test.js` | headless engine tests incl. the reachability sweep and the soak (wired into `run-all-tests.mjs`) |

`machine.js`, `boards.js`, `physics.js` and `game.js` are DOM-free and that is load-bearing:
`node skeeball/js/test.js` plays hundreds of throws in node (cannon-es runs fine there), and the
same determinism is why the tuning is testable at all.

## The vendored engines (the one "no dependencies" exception, and why)

Matt, 2026-08-13, after three rounds of hand-rolled physics kept failing his eye test and he was
told the good apps are built on general-purpose physics engines: *"Why didn't we use that from
the start??? Use ALL AVAILABLE resources like this. 'battle-tested' codes and scripts... are way
better and preferred by a TON over anything you build directly. Go - vendor cannon-es and
rebuild it on that... If any other things like this cannon-es thing exist - FIND AND USE IT."*

So `skeeball/js/vendor/` holds cannon-es 0.20.0 and three.js r185 as committed ES-module files.
This honors the repo's real constraints (static files, no build step, works offline - the three
files are in `sw.js`'s ASSETS) while bending the letter of "no dependencies" on Matt's explicit
instruction. The lesson generalizes: for solved hard problems (physics, 3D rendering), vendor
the proven library instead of imitating its output by hand. Do NOT hand-patch vendor files; to
upgrade, `npm pack <name>` and copy the dist build over.

## The setup screen and How To Play (rebuilt 2026-08-13 to the repo patterns)

The first versions of both were designed from scratch and Matt threw them out ("start the design
over" / "throw out 100% of it"). The rebuilds follow the documented references EXACTLY; a future
redesign starts from those documents, not from taste:

- **Setup** follows Escoba's page order (`escoba/js/ui.js`, the repo's setup reference): title →
  Resume button if a save exists → one stats line (Best · Today · Top · Last) → the settings card
  as a collapsed `.gh-acc` accordion row ("Machine / THE CLASSIC"; open it to pick a machine,
  each unlocked machine a card with its four records) → the How-to-play text link → ONE primary
  action (Play, or New game as a ghost when Resume is the primary). Built on `css/ui.css`'s
  `.gh-*` primitives (`ui.js` injects `css/ui.css` idempotently before its own sheet, the same
  marker `bug-report-ui.js` uses) — the accordion is `.gh-acc`, the buttons are `.gh-btn`; only
  the skeeball-specific bits (`.sk-statline`, `.sk-mrow`, `.sk-howto-link`) are local CSS.
- **How To Play** follows `tic-tac-toe/CLAUDE.md`'s five-part pattern, restated in `howto.js`'s
  header: one bold goal line, ONE diagram of the one non-obvious mechanic (swipe strength =
  landing height, drawn as a side view with three numbered arcs), a caption, an X = Y example
  ("Half strength = the 50 cup"), then the edge cases one sentence each. Every text line is
  measured and shrunk to fit ONE row before nowrap locks it (`_fitHelpLines` in `ui.js`); the
  arcs are told apart by dash pattern AND numbered markers, never colour alone.

## The machine and its physics (cannon-es since 2026-08-13)

The hand-rolled collision model went through two full rebuilds (decided-at-contact → emergent
face simulation) and still failed Matt's eye test: *"you can clearly tell it's being told to
react a certain way."* It was replaced wholesale by cannon-es (see "The vendored engines"), and
nothing scripts a reaction any more:

- **The machine is real geometry** (`machine.js`): lane, hump quarter-pipe (launch angle IS the
  last segment's angle), trough, tilted board slab (~32 degrees), ring band and cup collars as
  flush box-segment polygons, rails, tall backboard, the wire cage over the board, the front
  glass, a kick panel under the lip. The ball is a rigid sphere with mass and spin; rolling,
  hops, rim rattles and backboard reactions all come out of the contact solver.
- **The feel lives in exactly two places**: `boards.js`'s `geom` block (shapes, sizes, angles,
  launch speed range) and the four ContactMaterials at the top of `physics.js` (friction and
  restitution per surface pair - wood, board, slick steel walls, dead backboard/cage).
- **Hole capture is the one non-engine rule**, and it is what a hole IS: when the ball's centre
  is over an opening at face level, its collision mask drops the board slab and GRAVITY takes it
  through the mouth, still guided by the collar. No teleport, no canned sink.
- **The trough scores like the real bottom slot**: centre band = 10, corners = 0. A dead lob
  rolls into the 10, exactly like the real machine; the honest zero is the corner.
- **The dish**: the real board's lower bowl is dished so a slow ball inside the ring always
  finds the 20. Our slab is flat, so the dish is applied as the force it exerts (gentle pull
  toward the 20 for slow balls inside the ring only - fast rattles are never steered).
- **The 100s are the real tilted tubes** (`lipLow`): low front lip a rolling corner ball can
  hop in over, tall back lip that catches overshoot. Reachable only with a genuine sideways
  fling (~p0.78/a0.65-0.75 is the sweet spot the sweep finds); never with a straight ball.
- **The spacing rule** (in `boards.js`, learned twice): every gap between two pieces of
  furniture is either MERGED or wider than a ball plus margin. An in-between gap is a pocket,
  and a three-contact pocket LOCKS the cannon solver completely - velocity writes get solved
  back to zero. Check every neighbour pair before moving any cup.
- **The watchdog** (displacement-anchored, never speed): a parked ball gets popped off the face
  like real chatter; a ball two pops cannot move is jammed and gets walked out slowly toward
  the nearest mouth. The 12s cap should be unreachable; the tests keep the whole emergency
  path under 2% of the sweep.

Deterministic: fixed 1/240 step, fixed solver iterations, naive broadphase (stable pair order),
no rng anywhere. One fresh world per throw, so nothing leaks between balls. Retune freely, but
run `node skeeball/js/test.js` first - the sweep pins reachability of every hole, the rollback,
the straight-power ladder (30 → 40 → 50), overshoot paying on average, the >2s rattle, real
bounce events, and the emergency path staying rare.

The renderer (`render.js`, three.js) builds its scene from the SAME `machine.js` description,
plus paint. Reduced motion drops popup rise and particles, never the ball.

### How the cups are drawn, and the three ways it was got wrong first

Matt, on the first cannon-es build: *"Does it look ANYTHING like the screenshots I sent you?"* It
did not. Every fix below is a rule now, because each replaced something that shipped and failed:

- **The number goes on a PANEL on the cup's front, not wrapped round the tube.** A cylinder's
  front arc is only a few tens of degrees wide from the player's high viewpoint, so a texture
  wrapped around the wall loses its outer digits round the curve - "100" rendered as ")0", "50"
  as "0". Repeating the number around the circumference (the attempt before that) turned every
  cup into a barrel of digits, half of them mirrored by the far wall seen through the mouth.
- **Panels are sized off the WALL's height, never the radius**, or a wide cup's panel overhangs
  its wall and covers the mouth of the next cup down the ladder.
- **A cup's inside is dark; the big RING's inside is not.** The ring is a fence standing on the
  board, and giving it the cups' dark interior painted a giant black pit across the playfield.
- **Nothing is labelled twice.** Value stencils on the field AND panels on the cups produced
  ghost duplicates beside every cup - the thing that made the board read as numbers scattered
  on a plank. The field carries only the 10 slot, the corner 0s and a soft target ring.
- The cage is drawn THIN and pale; heavy dark bars sit between the camera and the board and turn
  the top half of the screen into a fence. The backboard wears the machine's name, because a
  blank brown wall at the end of the lane is not an arcade machine.
- The key light is nearly overhead. A strongly side-lit key threw a hard diagonal shadow band
  across the playfield that read as dirt on the board.

### Wall heights are a PHYSICS parameter, not a look parameter

Deepening the cups to make them read as cups made the 40 literally unreachable (the 30's back
wall shielded it) - caught by the sweep, not by eye. Two rules came out of it:

- **Every cup is `lipLow`**: on a real sloped board a cup's down-slope edge sits nearly flush and
  its up-slope edge stands proud, which is exactly what lets a rolling ball drop in over the
  front while an overshoot is still caught by the back. Uniform-height walls deep enough to see
  into are walls the ball cannot cross.
- **Board restitution decides whether the game is LEARNABLE.** A livelier board lets the carom,
  not the landing, choose the cup, and the straight-power ladder stops being monotonic (0.35
  landed the 40 while 0.45 landed the 30). It is 0.26 - a real wooden board is not bouncy.
- `maxSpeed` is then set so slamming genuinely overshoots: mid power averages ~40, full power
  ~15. Both facts are asserted, so neither can quietly drift.

## The records panel (the four numbers every machine shows)

Per Matt's spec, each machine displays: the **top score by ANY player**, the current player's
**all-time best**, their **best today**, and **the score they just rolled**. Where each one lives:

- **Top score (anyone)**: derived at read time — `readPlayersOnce()` → `aggregatePlayers()` →
  `appWideBest(rows, 'skeeball', 'sk', boardId)` (`js/arcade-scores.js`; there is deliberately no
  shared `highscores/` node — see that file's header). Local history is merged over it so an
  unsynced device still shows its own truth. Async; the panel renders local-first and fills in.
- **Your best / today**: `bestOn` / `todayBestOn` over the player's own `sk.boards[boardId]`
  (the daily best is a date-keyed map that never resets — arcade-scores' header explains why).
- **Just rolled**: the rack-over sheet, plus a session-only "Last game" slot on the machine card
  (deliberately not persisted: the durable copies already live in the daily map and bests).

"NEW BEST" pills on the rack-over sheet compare against what stood BEFORE the rack was recorded.

## Persistence and THE LAW

**The stats id `skeeball` and sub-counter `sk` predate this rewrite and carry real plays.**
Everything this build writes goes through the SAME shared plumbing the old one used, so that
history keeps accumulating rather than being orphaned:

- `recordSkeeball(boardId, { score, balls, hundreds, fifties, bestThrow, at })` in
  `js/game-stats.js` — called exactly once per finished rack (`recorded` guard; every write in
  the store is additive, so a double call would silently inflate). `byDiff` buckets by board id;
  the first machine's id is **`classic`**, which is also `recordSkeeball`'s own fallback id —
  frozen forever (rule 5). Rename a machine's display name freely; never its id.
- Per-machine records and unlocks ride `sk.boards` / `sk.unlocked` via `js/arcade-scores.js`
  (counters add, bests `Math.max`, each DAY takes the max, unlocks union across devices).
- The frozen vs-computer fields (`sk.won`/`lost`/`tied`, from the pre-2026-08-11 build) are
  untouched: never incremented, never cleared, still shown by My Stats when non-zero.
- This game's own keys hold nothing earned: `gamehub.skeeball.v1` is one preference and
  `gamehub.skeeball.save.v1` is a mid-rack snapshot that is cleared only AFTER the rack it
  describes has been recorded to the shared store. Nothing in this folder's storage can lose
  anything, because nothing earned lives in it (Pinball's model).
- Item 7's three edits (`ensureSk`/`recordSkeeball`, the My Stats screen, the `players-agg.js`
  branch) all predate this rewrite and were left as they are; `players-agg.test.mjs` carries the
  regression case.

The leaderboard row is deliberately absent while the game is admin-only (`GAME_META` in
`js/leaderboard-ui.js` says so in place; `players-agg.test.mjs`'s `OFF_THE_BOARD` checks the
claim). The My Stats tab is deliberately PRESENT and not devOnly — family members may have real
plays from the hours the old build was live, and hiding the tab would make their own history
invisible (rule 1; the comment on the `TABS` row records this).

## Adding the next machine

1. Add an entry to `BOARDS` in `js/boards.js`: new frozen `id`, marquee `name` (a proper noun,
   untranslated), `taglineKey` (+ its `{en,es}` strings), `look`, `geom`, and
   `unlock: { board: '<previous id>', score: N }`. Obey `geom`'s spacing rule for every
   neighbour pair, and re-run the sweep - reachability is a property of the whole layout.
2. Run `node skeeball/js/test.js` — the sweep and soak run against every board in the list, and
   the unlock chain tests are already written (they currently exercise a synthetic future list).
3. `ui.js` needs nothing: the gallery, unlock checks (`unlocksEarned` → `unlockSkeeballBoard`),
   records panel and renderer are all board-generic. The unlock write is additive and merged as
   a union across devices, so a machine earned anywhere is earned everywhere.
4. Nothing in `sw.js` changes (no per-board assets). Update THIS file's header, which currently
   says one machine exists.

## Testing

- `node skeeball/js/test.js` — 41 assertions (~1 min; cannon runs every throw for real):
  determinism, the reachability sweep (every hole, the rollback, emergencies rare), the
  straight-power ladder (30 → 40 → 50) and overshoot-pays-on-average, the >2s rattle with real
  bounce events, statistical left/right symmetry (knife-edge throws may split - the solver
  iterates contacts in list order), a 250-throw soak (settles, in bounds, legal values only),
  the nine-ball rules through the real API, the recorder payload shape, snapshot/restore, and
  the unlock chain.
- `node test-game-conventions.mjs` — the shared checklist (viewport, touch, overlays, name gate,
  module contract, listener balance, dictionary, the layout-class collision rule).
- `node test-visual.mjs skeeball` — the only suite that LOOKS at it. Its PLAY probe swipes the
  real lane with real touch through full racks and asserts the score moved and the rack recorded.
  There is no separate MOTION probe for the same reason as Pinball: everything that moves is
  drawn into one canvas, so the canvas-sampling check lives inside the PLAY probe.

## Things a future session will want to know

- **No sound, no audio layer** — the arcade-cabinet precedent (Matt on Pinball, 2026-08-11:
  "Delete the sound option. No sound."). Nothing here constructs an AudioContext.
- **`skeeball.css` is two skins and the split is deliberate** (2026-08-13, the setup overhaul):
  the SETUP and HOW-TO screens belong to the hub — light `--sks-*` tokens on `.sk-root` with a
  `:root.gh-dark .sk-root` override, skeeball_old's lines 9-35 pattern — while the PLAY screen
  keeps the warm dark arcade look in both themes (Ball Run/Hill Climb/Pinball's class). The
  header comment in the CSS marks where one skin ends and the other begins. Do not "unify" them.
- The swipe measures the RELEASE flick (the last ~130ms), not the whole gesture — the wind-up is
  grip, not power. Power normalises against the stage height so a phone and a desktop feel
  alike. **Samples are clocked with `e.timeStamp`, never `performance.now()`** — under load the
  handlers run late and bunched, and handler-time clocking collapses a strong swipe into a
  dribble. That bug only shows on a busy main thread, which is exactly a cheap phone.
- `physics.js` has no randomness at all. If a future machine wants scatter, thread a seeded rng
  through `startThrow` and keep `simulateThrow` deterministic — the test suite depends on it.
- **Three WebGL lessons paid for in debugging time** (all in `render.js`, commented in place):
  a `position:absolute` canvas is a REPLACED element, so `inset:0` does not stretch it —
  `setSize(w, h, true)` must set the style or the frame is an unscaled top-left crop; software
  GL (SwiftShader — headless tests, GPU-less desktops) is detected up front and sheds shadows,
  antialiasing and resolution, or the main thread starves and even input dies; and
  `preserveDrawingBuffer: true` stays on because test-visual's play probe and Report a bug's
  screenshot both read the canvas, which is blank without it.
- `window.__skTest` (set in `init()`) is the read-only hook the headless drivers use to
  sequence real-touch play; the `__yzTest` precedent. Never used by the game itself.
- Machine names (`THE CLASSIC`) are proper nouns and stay untranslated, like STARHUB.
